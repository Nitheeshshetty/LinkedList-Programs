Problem Statement :
-------------------
Given a singly linked list and a number k, you are required to complete the function modularNode() which returns the modular node of the linked list.
A modular node is the last node of the linked list whose Index is divisible by the number k, i.e. i%k==0.<br/>
Your Task  is You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function modularNode() which takes the head Node and integer k as input parameters and returns the modular Node, if exists, -1 otherwise.
