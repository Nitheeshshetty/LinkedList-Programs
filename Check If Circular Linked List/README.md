Problem Statement :
------------------
Given head, the head of a singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not. A linked list is called circular if it not NULL terminated and all nodes are connected in the form of a cycle. An empty linked list is considered as circular.<br/>
The task is to complete the function isCircular() which checks if the given linked list is circular or not. It should return true or false accordingly. (the driver code prints 1 if the returned values is true, otherwise 0).
