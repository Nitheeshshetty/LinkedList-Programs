Problem Statement :
------------------
Given a singly linked list consisting of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicates (nodes with duplicate values) from the given list (if exists).<br/>
Note: Try not to use extra space. Expected time complexity is O(N). The nodes are arranged in a sorted way.<br/>
The task is to complete the function removeDuplicates() which should remove the duplicates from linked list and return the head of the linkedlist.
