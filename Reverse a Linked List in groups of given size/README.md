Problem Statement :
-------------------
Given a linked list of size N. The task is to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function) in the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should be considered as a group and must be reversed (See Example 2 for clarification).

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function reverse() which should reverse the linked list in group of size k and return the head of the modified linked list.
