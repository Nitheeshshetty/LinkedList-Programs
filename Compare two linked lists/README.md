Problem Statement :
-------------------
Given two string, represented as linked lists (every character is a node->data in the linked list). Write a function compare() that works similar to strcmp(), i.e., it returns 0 if both strings are same, 1 if first linked list is lexicographically greater, and -1 if second is lexicographically greater.
