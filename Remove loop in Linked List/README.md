Problem Statement :
------------------
Given a linked list of N nodes such that it may contain a loop.<br/>
A loop here means that the last node of the link list is connected to the node at position X(1-based index). If the link list does not have any loop, X=0.<br/>
Remove the loop from the linked list, if it is present, i.e. unlink the last node which is forming the loop.
